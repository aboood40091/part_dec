Wii Partition Decryptor  
Converts Wii ISOs to decrypted partition bin files.    
Bugs:
Doesn't check if the partition is decrypted and tries to decrypt it anyway. Just like any other tool...    
The output bin files will end with two numbers, the first is the VG number and the second is the partition number.
